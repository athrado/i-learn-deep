# Deep Learning Projects

Here I present some of my projects for practising Deep Learning and Tensorflow.

### Project: [Seq2seq Model for Simple Math Problems](https://github.com/athrado/i-learn-deep/blob/main/Solve_math_problems_with_seq2seq_model.ipynb)

In this project, we use a RNN seq2seq neural network model for solving simple addition and substraction problems. As an exercise for seq2seq models, the query and solution are given as a string - so we solve these mathematical problems using a string-based approach. We reach an accuracy of  64.39%.
